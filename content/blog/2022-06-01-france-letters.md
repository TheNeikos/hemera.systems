# Writing Letters in France

I live in France, in the middle of the countryside. 
I enjoy it here, as its quieter than in a city and the air is, usually, clean. 
But one thing that it is missing is the density of infrastructure that a city can afford.
Of course I knew that coming here, but it is still annoying going to the next town just to post a letter.

But! I've recently learned that the french national mail company [LaPoste](https://laposte.fr) also allows you to post letters from your home!
I've had to send some important letters, but didn't feel like going out :P! 
Using their website I could print a simple vignette, stick it to the envelope and just put it in my own postbox!
The next day, the postman will pick it up as if you had brough it to a post office.

Amazing, and definitely a win for comfort and not having to go out!
