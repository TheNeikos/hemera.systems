## Creating an Age of Engineering Server

Since this is somewhat obscure, to get an AoE server going, you need to:

- Get a client running of it (Use polymc)
- Get the forge version for it (latest for https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.10.2.html)
- Run the server installer thrice (first time, then accept the EULA, then 
- copy the mods, config, resources and scripts folders to the server
- Have fun!
