# Emotional Management

Some notes on this, in my opinion, very important topic. It's not meant to be groundbreaking or even relevant for anyone else. 
It's basically just a braindump of how I see this topic.

## Core Ideas

- Emotions govern all actions individuals perform
- People optimize for low emotional pain
  - This can mean that either some actions are simply not performed, or reframed until they do not become a pain anymore.
  - An example being for example cognitive dissonance, where 'facing' the truth might hurt more than simply ignoring or downplaying it.
